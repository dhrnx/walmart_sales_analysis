### A Data Analyst Portfolio Project  

This end-to-end data analytics project explores **Walmart store sales performance** to uncover trends, seasonal patterns, and economic influences.

---

## Project Overview  

The project follows a real-world **data analysis workflow**, starting from raw data exploration to SQL queries and interactive dashboard visualization.

**Key Objectives:**
- Analyze Walmart’s store-level sales data  
- Identify top-performing stores  
- Compare sales during holiday vs non-holiday periods  
- Study relationships between unemployment and sales  
- Create a professional Tableau dashboard  

---

## Tools & Technologies Used  

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|----------|
| **Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)** | Data Cleaning & EDA |
| **MySQL** | Data Storage & SQL Queries |
| **Tableau Public** | Data Visualization & Dashboard |
| **GitHub** | Version Control & Portfolio Presentation |

---

## Data Cleaning  

Performed using Python in Jupyter Notebook:
- Removed duplicates and nulls  
- Standardized date formats (`%d-%m-%Y`)  
- Converted categorical variables  
- Saved final dataset to `/data/processed/walmart_sales_clean.csv`

---

## SQL Analysis  

Key business queries stored in `/sql/analysis_queries.sql`:

```sql
-- Top 10 Stores by Average Weekly Sales
SELECT Store, ROUND(AVG(Weekly_Sales),2) AS avg_weekly_sales
FROM sales_data
GROUP BY Store
ORDER BY avg_weekly_sales DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

Other analyses include:
- Total sales during holiday vs non-holiday weeks  
- Monthly average sales  
- Correlation between unemployment and weekly sales  
- Yearly performance by store
